          Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an
          enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by
          love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a
          terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to

          the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her
          true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna
